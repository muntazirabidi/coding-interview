# Coding Interview Preparation

This repository contains solutions to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems that I have solved as part of my interview preparation.

## Current Topics
- **Graphs**: Solutions include BFS, DFS, Connected Components, Shortest Path, and more.

## Structure
- `Graphs/`: Solutions to graph-related problems.
- Other folders (e.g., Arrays, Trees) will be added as I solve more problems.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/muntazirabidi/coding-interview.git
   cd coding-interview
