# N-Queens Problem:

## Understanding the Problem

Let's break down this classic backtracking problem in a way that would impress interviewers with your problem-solving approach.

### Initial Problem Analysis

When an interviewer presents you with the N-Queens problem, you should demonstrate your understanding by explaining:

"The N-Queens problem asks us to place N chess queens on an N×N board such that no queen can attack another queen. A solution exists when no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. For example, on a 4×4 board, we need to place 4 queens safely."

### Key Observations to Share

During the interview, you should vocalize these important observations:

1. Row Constraint: "Since queens attack horizontally, each row can only contain one queen."
2. Column Constraint: "Similarly, since queens attack vertically, each column must contain exactly one queen."
3. Diagonal Constraints: "Queens attack diagonally in both directions, so we need to check both positive and negative diagonals."

## Developing the Solution Approach

### 1. Initial Optimization

Start by telling the interviewer: "Instead of trying every cell on the board (which would be N² positions for each queen), we can make an important optimization. Since we know each row must contain exactly one queen, we can place queens row by row. This reduces our choices to N positions per row."

### 2. Understanding Diagonal Patterns

Here's a clever insight to share: "There are patterns we can use to identify diagonals:

- For negative diagonals (top-left to bottom-right), cells sharing the same diagonal have the same value of (row - column)
- For positive diagonals (bottom-left to top-right), cells sharing the same diagonal have the same value of (row + column)"

### 3. Tracking Valid Positions

Explain your data structure choice: "We can efficiently track occupied positions using three sets:

- columns: to track which columns have queens
- positive_diagonals: storing (row + column) values
- negative_diagonals: storing (row - column) values"

## Implementation Strategy

Here's an optimized Python solution with detailed explanations:

```python
def solveNQueens(n: int) -> list[list[str]]:
    # Initialize our tracking sets
    columns = set()
    positive_diagonals = set()  # will store (row + col)
    negative_diagonals = set()  # will store (row - col)

    # Initialize the board with empty cells
    board = [['.'] * n for _ in range(n)]
    result = []

    def backtrack(row: int) -> None:
        # Base case: If we've placed queens in all rows, we've found a solution
        if row == n:
            # Convert the current board state to the required string format
            current_solution = [''.join(row) for row in board]
            result.append(current_solution)
            return

        # Try placing a queen in each column of the current row
        for col in range(n):
            # Calculate the diagonal values for current position
            curr_positive_diagonal = row + col
            curr_negative_diagonal = row - col

            # If this position is under attack, skip it
            if (col in columns or
                curr_positive_diagonal in positive_diagonals or
                curr_negative_diagonal in negative_diagonals):
                continue

            # Place the queen and update our tracking sets
            columns.add(col)
            positive_diagonals.add(curr_positive_diagonal)
            negative_diagonals.add(curr_negative_diagonal)
            board[row][col] = 'Q'

            # Recurse to the next row
            backtrack(row + 1)

            # Backtrack: remove the queen and clean up our tracking sets
            columns.remove(col)
            positive_diagonals.remove(curr_positive_diagonal)
            negative_diagonals.remove(curr_negative_diagonal)
            board[row][col] = '.'

    # Start the backtracking from row 0
    backtrack(0)
    return result
```

## Explaining Time and Space Complexity

When the interviewer asks about complexity, explain:

"The time complexity is O(N!). This is because:

1. For the first row, we have N choices
2. For the second row, we have at most (N-1) choices
3. For the third row, we have at most (N-2) choices
   And so on, giving us N _ (N-1) _ (N-2) _ ... _ 1 = N! possible combinations to explore.

The space complexity is O(N²) for storing the board, plus O(N) for our tracking sets."

## Common Interview Follow-up Questions

Be prepared for these common follow-ups:

1. "Can you optimize the solution further?"

   - Response: "We could use bit manipulation to track queen positions, reducing space complexity for tracking sets to O(1)."

2. "How would you modify the code to only count solutions instead of storing them?"

   - Response: "We could remove the board representation and just use a counter, reducing space complexity."

3. "What if we only needed to find one solution instead of all solutions?"
   - Response: "We could modify the backtrack function to return True when we find the first solution, stopping further exploration."

## Interview Tips

1. Start by explaining your understanding of the problem and constraints.
2. Mention the optimization of placing queens row by row before diving into code.
3. Explain the diagonal pattern observation – it shows deeper understanding.
4. Write clean, well-commented code that uses meaningful variable names.
5. Be ready to analyze time and space complexity in detail.
