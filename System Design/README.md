## 1. Computer Architecture

Understanding computer architecture is fundamental to system design as it helps us make informed decisions about resource allocation and optimization.

### Data Units

Understanding data units is crucial for capacity planning and performance optimization:

- **Bit**: The most fundamental unit of information in computing, representing either a 0 or 1. All data in computers is ultimately stored and processed as bits.
- **Byte**: A group of 8 bits that can represent 256 different values (2^8). One byte typically stores one character in ASCII encoding.
- **Scale**: The progression of data units follows powers of 1024 (2^10):
  - 1 Kilobyte (KB) = 1,024 bytes
  - 1 Megabyte (MB) = 1,024 KB
  - 1 Gigabyte (GB) = 1,024 MB
  - 1 Terabyte (TB) = 1,024 GB

### Storage Hierarchy

The storage hierarchy represents a trade-off between speed, cost, and capacity. As we move up the hierarchy, speed increases but capacity decreases and cost per byte increases.

1. **Disk Storage**

   - Functions as the permanent data store, retaining data even when power is off (non-volatile)
   - HDD uses mechanical parts (spinning disks and moving heads), making it slower but cheaper
   - SSD uses flash memory with no moving parts, offering faster access but at higher cost
   - The speed difference is significant: reading a 1GB file might take 6-7 seconds on HDD but only 1-2 seconds on SSD

2. **RAM (Random Access Memory)**

   - Acts as the computer's "working memory", providing quick access to active data
   - Unlike disk storage, RAM is volatile, meaning data is lost when power is cut
   - The speed advantage is substantial: RAM can process data about 100,000 times faster than disk storage
   - Modern applications heavily rely on RAM for performance optimization

3. **Cache**

   - Serves as an ultra-fast buffer between RAM and CPU
   - Organized in levels with decreasing speed but increasing size:
     - L1 Cache: Smallest (32-64KB) but fastest (access time ~1ns)
     - L2 Cache: Larger (256KB-1MB) but slightly slower (~4ns)
     - L3 Cache: Largest (several MB) but slowest of cache levels (~10ns)
   - The "cache hit ratio" is a crucial metric indicating how often data is found in cache

4. **CPU**
   - The brain of the computer that performs all computations
   - Modern CPUs can execute billions of instructions per second
   - The compilation process transforms human-readable code into machine instructions:
     1. Source code (e.g., Python) → Intermediate code
     2. Intermediate code → Machine code (binary)
     3. CPU executes machine code instructions

## 2. Production App Architecture

Understanding how applications work in production is crucial for system design. This architecture encompasses everything from how code gets deployed to how issues are handled in real-time.

### CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment forms the backbone of modern software delivery. This automated pipeline ensures code changes are reliably and safely deployed to production.

The process typically flows as follows:

1. Developers commit code to a repository
2. CI system automatically:
   - Builds the application
   - Runs automated tests
   - Performs security scans
   - Checks code quality
3. CD system then:
   - Deploys to staging environment
   - Runs integration tests
   - Deploys to production
   - Monitors deployment health

Tools like Jenkins and GitHub Actions provide extensive customization options and can be integrated with various testing and monitoring tools.

### Key Components

1. **Load Balancers**
   Load balancers are crucial for distributing traffic and ensuring high availability. They:

   - Act as the first point of contact for user requests
   - Distribute traffic based on various algorithms
   - Perform health checks on servers
   - Prevent any single server from becoming overwhelmed
   - Tools like Nginx can handle thousands of concurrent connections

2. **External Storage**
   Separating storage from application servers provides several benefits:

   - Better scalability - storage can be scaled independently
   - Improved reliability - storage persists even if application servers fail
   - Enhanced security - storage can be isolated and protected separately
   - Easier backup and recovery processes

3. **Logging & Monitoring**
   A robust logging and monitoring system is essential for maintaining application health:
   - Backend (PM2):
     - Monitors Node.js applications
     - Provides process management
     - Offers load balancing capabilities
   - Frontend (Sentry):
     - Tracks client-side errors
     - Provides crash reporting
     - Offers performance monitoring
   - External logging:
     - Aggregates logs from multiple sources
     - Enables log analysis and searching
     - Maintains audit trails

### Alert System

A well-designed alert system helps catch and address issues before they impact users.

1. **Detection**
   The system should monitor various metrics:

   - Error rates and status codes
   - Response times and latency
   - System resource utilization
   - Business metrics (e.g., failed transactions)
   - Custom application metrics

2. **Notification**
   Modern alert systems use multiple channels:
   - Slack integration for team communication
   - Email for detailed reports
   - SMS/phone calls for critical issues
   - PagerDuty or similar for on-call rotations

### Debugging Process

A systematic approach to debugging production issues:

1. **Log Analysis**

   - Aggregate logs from all services
   - Look for patterns and anomalies
   - Track error frequency and impact

2. **Issue Replication**

   - Create a controlled test environment
   - Reproduce the issue safely
   - Verify the problem's root cause

3. **Safe Environment Debug**

   - Use debugging tools without affecting production
   - Test potential fixes
   - Validate solutions thoroughly

4. **Hotfix Deployment**

   - Quick, targeted fix
   - Minimal changes to reduce risk
   - Immediate relief for critical issues

5. **Permanent Solution**
   - Comprehensive fix addressing root cause
   - Updated documentation
   - Prevention measures for similar issues

## 3. Design Requirements

Design requirements form the foundation of any system design decision. Understanding these requirements helps create systems that are not just functional but also reliable and scalable.

### Key Principles

1. **Scalability**
   The ability of a system to handle growth. This includes:

   - Vertical Scalability: Adding more power to existing machines
   - Horizontal Scalability: Adding more machines
   - Data Scalability: Managing growing data effectively
   - Geographic Scalability: Handling users across regions

2. **Maintainability**
   Systems should be designed for long-term maintenance:

   - Clear documentation
   - Modular architecture
   - Consistent coding standards
   - Automated testing
   - Easy deployment processes

3. **Efficiency**
   Optimal use of resources while maintaining performance:
   - CPU utilization
   - Memory management
   - Network bandwidth usage
   - Cost optimization
   - Energy efficiency

### CAP Theorem

The CAP theorem is fundamental to distributed systems design, often guiding critical architecture decisions. Let's understand each component in detail:

**Consistency**
In a distributed system, consistency ensures that all nodes see the same data at the same time. Think of it like a shared document:

- When one person makes a change, everyone should see that change immediately
- All reads should return the most recent write
- Every replica should have the same data
- Example: Banking systems prioritize consistency to ensure accurate account balances

**Availability**
A guarantee that every request to a non-failing node receives a response:

- The system remains operational even under heavy load
- Every request gets a response (success or failure)
- No request should hang indefinitely
- Example: Social media platforms often prioritize availability over consistency

**Partition Tolerance**
The system continues to operate despite network partitions (communication breaks between nodes):

- Network failures between nodes shouldn't cause system failure
- The system must handle delayed or lost messages
- Must continue functioning when network splits occur
- Example: Global services must handle network issues between data centers

The fundamental tradeoff: When a network partition occurs, you must choose between:

- Maintaining consistency (refusing writes to prevent inconsistent data)
- Maintaining availability (accepting writes but allowing inconsistent data)

### Performance Metrics

Understanding performance metrics is crucial for setting and meeting system requirements.

**1. Availability**
Availability is typically measured in "nines":

- 99.9% (Three nines) = 8.76 hours downtime/year
- 99.99% (Four nines) = 52.6 minutes downtime/year
- 99.999% (Five nines) = 5.26 minutes downtime/year

Real-world considerations:

- Planned maintenance should be considered in availability calculations
- Geographic redundancy can improve availability
- Cost increases exponentially with each "nine"
- Example: A credit card processing system might require five nines availability

**2. SLOs (Service Level Objectives)**
Internal goals that help teams maintain service quality:

- More stringent than SLAs
- Help catch issues before they affect SLAs
- Examples:
  - API response time < 200ms for 99% of requests
  - Error rate < 0.1% over 5 minutes
  - 99.95% availability over 30 days

**3. SLAs (Service Level Agreements)**
Formal contracts with users/customers:

- Legal implications if breached
- Usually less stringent than SLOs
- Often include:
  - Uptime guarantees
  - Response time commitments
  - Problem resolution timeframes
  - Compensation terms for breaches

## 4. Networking Basics

Networking fundamentals are crucial for understanding how systems communicate. Let's explore each concept in detail.

### IP Addressing

**IPv4**
The traditional addressing system:

- 32-bit addresses (4 bytes)
- Format: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (each xxx is 0-255)
- Total addresses: ~4.3 billion
- Example: 192.168.1.1

Address classes:

- Class A: Large networks (0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255)
- Class B: Medium networks (128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255)
- Class C: Small networks (192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255)

**IPv6**
The newer addressing system:

- 128-bit addresses (16 bytes)
- Format: xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx
- Practically unlimited addresses
- Example: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

[Previous sections remain the same...]

### DNS (Domain Name System)

The Domain Name System serves as the internet's phone book. Understanding how DNS works is crucial for system design, especially when building globally distributed systems.

**Resolution Process**:

1. User enters domain (e.g., www.example.com)
2. Local DNS cache is checked first
3. If not found, query goes to recursive resolver
4. Resolver checks with root nameservers
5. Root servers direct to TLD servers (.com, .org, etc.)
6. TLD servers direct to authoritative nameservers
7. Authoritative servers provide final IP address

**Record Types**:

- A Records: Map domain names to IPv4 addresses
- AAAA Records: Map to IPv6 addresses
- CNAME: Create domain aliases
- MX: Specify mail servers
- TXT: Store text information
- NS: Specify nameservers
- SOA: Contain administrative information

**TTL (Time To Live)**:

- Controls how long DNS records are cached
- Shorter TTL: Faster propagation but more DNS queries
- Longer TTL: Better performance but slower updates
- Common values:
  - 300 seconds (5 minutes) for frequently changing records
  - 86400 seconds (1 day) for stable records

## 5. Application Layer Protocols

Application layer protocols define how applications communicate. Understanding these protocols is essential for building networked systems.

## 6. API Design

API design is a crucial skill in system design, as APIs serve as the contract between different components of a system. Let's explore how to design robust and maintainable APIs.

### REST API

REST (Representational State Transfer) has become the de facto standard for web APIs due to its simplicity and scalability. Let's understand its core principles and best practices.

**Fundamental Principles:**

The REST architectural style is built on six key constraints:

1. **Client-Server Architecture**
   This separation of concerns allows each to evolve independently. The client handles the user interface, while the server manages data storage and business logic. For example, a mobile app can be completely redesigned without changing the server, and server architecture can be modified without affecting the client.

2. **Statelessness**
   Each request must contain all information needed to understand and complete it. The server should not store client state between requests. Consider an e-commerce API:

   Good (Stateless):

   ```http
   GET /api/cart/123
   Authorization: Bearer user_token_xyz
   ```

   Bad (Stateful):

   ```http
   GET /api/current_user_cart
   // Relies on server remembering who current user is
   ```

3. **Cacheability**
   Responses must explicitly state if they're cacheable. This improves scalability and performance. For example:

   ```http
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Cache-Control: max-age=3600
   ETag: "33a64df551425fcc55e4d42a148795d9f25f89d4"
   ```

4. **Uniform Interface**
   REST APIs should follow consistent conventions. Resource naming is particularly important:

   Good naming:

   ```
   GET /api/users/123/orders        // Get user's orders
   POST /api/products               // Create new product
   PUT /api/products/456            // Update product
   DELETE /api/products/456         // Delete product
   ```

Real-world example of a RESTful API for an e-commerce system:

```http
# List products with pagination
GET /api/products?page=1&limit=20

# Get specific product
GET /api/products/123

# Create order
POST /api/orders
{
  "user_id": "789",
  "products": [
    {"id": "123", "quantity": 2},
    {"id": "456", "quantity": 1}
  ],
  "shipping_address": {
    "street": "123 Main St",
    "city": "San Francisco",
    "zip": "94105"
  }
}

# Update order status
PATCH /api/orders/321
{
  "status": "shipped",
  "tracking_number": "1Z999AA1234567890"
}
```

### GraphQL

GraphQL represents a paradigm shift in API design, offering more flexibility and efficiency in data fetching. Let's understand its key concepts through examples.

**Core Concepts:**

1. **Schema Definition**
   The schema defines the API's capabilities:

   ```graphql
   type User {
     id: ID!
     name: String!
     email: String!
     orders: [Order!]!
   }

   type Order {
     id: ID!
     createdAt: DateTime!
     products: [Product!]!
     totalAmount: Float!
   }

   type Query {
     user(id: ID!): User
     orders(userId: ID!): [Order!]!
   }

   type Mutation {
     createOrder(userId: ID!, products: [ProductInput!]!): Order!
   }
   ```

2. **Queries**
   Clients can request exactly what they need:

   ```graphql
   # Get user with specific fields
   query {
     user(id: "123") {
       name
       orders {
         id
         totalAmount
         products {
           name
           price
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Resolvers**
   Server-side functions that fulfill requests:

   ```javascript
   const resolvers = {
     Query: {
       user: async (_, { id }) => {
         return await User.findById(id);
       },
     },
     User: {
       orders: async (parent) => {
         return await Order.findByUserId(parent.id);
       },
     },
   };
   ```

### Versioning Strategies

API versioning is crucial for maintaining backward compatibility while allowing evolution. Let's examine different approaches:

1. **URL Versioning**
   Most explicit and commonly used:

   ```
   /api/v1/products
   /api/v2/products
   ```

   Advantages:

   - Clear and explicit
   - Easy to understand
   - Simple to route

2. **Header Versioning**

   ```http
   GET /api/products
   Accept-Version: 2.0
   ```

   Advantages:

   - Cleaner URLs
   - More flexible
   - Better for caching

3. **Query Parameter Versioning**
   ```
   /api/products?version=2
   ```
   Advantages:
   - Easy to implement
   - Optional versioning
   - Good for backward compatibility

### Rate Limiting

Rate limiting protects your API from abuse and ensures fair usage. Let's explore implementation strategies:

1. **Token Bucket Algorithm**

   ```python
   class TokenBucket:
       def __init__(self, capacity, fill_rate):
           self.capacity = capacity  # Maximum tokens
           self.fill_rate = fill_rate  # Tokens added per second
           self.tokens = capacity  # Current token count
           self.last_update = time.time()

       def consume(self, tokens):
           now = time.time()
           # Add tokens based on time passed
           self.tokens += (now - self.last_update) * self.fill_rate
           self.tokens = min(self.tokens, self.capacity)
           self.last_update = now

           if self.tokens >= tokens:
               self.tokens -= tokens
               return True
           return False
   ```

2. **Redis-based Implementation**

   ```python
   def is_rate_limited(user_id, limit=100, window=3600):
       redis_key = f"rate_limit:{user_id}"
       current = redis.get(redis_key)

       if not current:
           redis.setex(redis_key, window, 1)
           return False

       if int(current) >= limit:
           return True

       redis.incr(redis_key)
       return False
   ```

## 7. Caching and CDNs

Caching is one of the most powerful techniques for improving system performance. When implemented correctly, it can dramatically reduce latency and server load while improving user experience.

### Caching Levels

Let's explore each caching level in detail, understanding when and how to use each one effectively.

#### 1. Browser Caching

Browser caching serves as the first line of defense in our performance optimization strategy. When implemented properly, it can eliminate unnecessary network requests entirely.

**Cache-Control Header Implementation:**

```http
# Aggressive caching for static assets
Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable

# Balanced caching for frequently updated content
Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600, must-revalidate

# No caching for sensitive data
Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, private
```

**Cache Validation:**

```http
# Using ETag
ETag: "33a64df551425fcc55e4d42a148795d9f25f89d4"
If-None-Match: "33a64df551425fcc55e4d42a148795d9f25f89d4"

# Using Last-Modified
Last-Modified: Wed, 21 Oct 2023 07:28:00 GMT
If-Modified-Since: Wed, 21 Oct 2023 07:28:00 GMT
```

When to use different caching strategies:

- Static assets (images, CSS, JS): Aggressive caching
- API responses: Short-term caching with validation
- User-specific data: No caching or private caching only

#### 2. Server Caching

Server caching provides a crucial performance layer between your application and database. Let's explore different implementation strategies:

**Redis Implementation Example:**

```python
class UserCache:
    def __init__(self, redis_client):
        self.redis = redis_client
        self.default_ttl = 3600  # 1 hour

    def get_user(self, user_id):
        # Try cache first
        cache_key = f"user:{user_id}"
        cached_user = self.redis.get(cache_key)

        if cached_user:
            return json.loads(cached_user)

        # Cache miss - fetch from database
        user = database.fetch_user(user_id)
        if user:
            # Cache for future requests
            self.redis.setex(
                cache_key,
                self.default_ttl,
                json.dumps(user)
            )
        return user

    def invalidate_user(self, user_id):
        self.redis.delete(f"user:{user_id}")
```

#### 3. Database Caching

Database caching involves multiple strategies working together to optimize query performance:

**Query Cache Implementation:**

```python
class QueryCache:
    def __init__(self, redis_client):
        self.redis = redis_client

    def execute_cached_query(self, query, params=None, ttl=300):
        # Generate cache key from query and params
        cache_key = self._generate_cache_key(query, params)

        # Try cache first
        cached_result = self.redis.get(cache_key)
        if cached_result:
            return json.loads(cached_result)

        # Execute query and cache results
        result = database.execute(query, params)
        self.redis.setex(
            cache_key,
            ttl,
            json.dumps(result)
        )
        return result

    def _generate_cache_key(self, query, params):
        return f"query:{hash(query + str(params))}"
```

### Cache Strategies

Let's examine each caching strategy in detail, understanding their trade-offs and best use cases.

#### 1. Write-Around Cache

This strategy bypasses the cache for write operations:

```python
def write_around_example(data, cache, database):
    # Write directly to database
    database.write(data)

    # Invalidate cache (optional)
    cache.delete(data.key)

    # Next read will populate cache
```

Best for:

- Write-heavy workloads
- Data that's rarely read
- Systems where write performance is critical

#### 2. Write-Through Cache

Ensures cache and database stay synchronized:

```python
def write_through_example(data, cache, database):
    # Write to database
    database.write(data)

    # Update cache
    cache.set(data.key, data)

    # Both cache and database are now consistent
```

Best for:

- Read-heavy workloads
- Systems requiring data consistency
- Applications where eventual consistency isn't acceptable

#### 3. Write-Back Cache

Optimizes for write performance:

```python
class WriteBackCache:
    def __init__(self, cache, database):
        self.cache = cache
        self.database = database
        self.write_queue = Queue()

    def write(self, data):
        # Write to cache immediately
        self.cache.set(data.key, data)

        # Queue for database write
        self.write_queue.put(data)

    def process_write_queue(self):
        while not self.write_queue.empty():
            data = self.write_queue.get()
            try:
                self.database.write(data)
            except Exception as e:
                # Handle failed writes
                self.write_queue.put(data)
                logger.error(f"Failed to write {data.key}: {e}")
```

Best for:

- High-frequency write operations
- Systems that can tolerate some data loss
- Applications where write performance is critical

### CDN (Content Delivery Network)

CDNs are crucial for delivering content to globally distributed users. Let's explore the implementation details:

#### Pull-based CDN Implementation

```python
class PullBasedCDN:
    def handle_request(self, resource_path):
        # Check if resource exists in CDN
        if self.exists_in_cdn(resource_path):
            return self.serve_from_cdn(resource_path)

        # Resource not in CDN - pull from origin
        content = self.pull_from_origin(resource_path)

        if content:
            # Store in CDN for future requests
            self.store_in_cdn(resource_path, content)
            return content

        return None

    def exists_in_cdn(self, path):
        # Check CDN cache
        return self.cdn_storage.exists(path)

    def pull_from_origin(self, path):
        try:
            response = requests.get(f"{ORIGIN_SERVER}/{path}")
            return response.content if response.ok else None
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Failed to pull from origin: {e}")
            return None
```

#### Push-based CDN Implementation

```python
class PushBasedCDN:
    def push_to_cdn(self, resource_path, content):
        # Push to all edge locations
        for edge_location in self.edge_locations:
            try:
                edge_location.store(resource_path, content)
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Failed to push to {edge_location}: {e}")

    def invalidate_resource(self, resource_path):
        # Invalidate resource across all edge locations
        for edge_location in self.edge_locations:
            edge_location.invalidate(resource_path)
```

## 8. Proxy Servers

Proxy servers act as intermediaries in network communication, providing crucial benefits for security, performance, and architecture. Let's explore their implementations and use cases in detail.

### Forward Proxy Implementation

Let's examine how a forward proxy works with a practical implementation:

```python
class ForwardProxy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = Cache()
        self.access_rules = AccessRules()
        self.rate_limiter = RateLimiter()

    async def handle_request(self, client_request):
        # Check access rules first
        if not self.access_rules.is_allowed(client_request):
            return ForbiddenResponse()

        # Check rate limits
        if self.rate_limiter.is_limited(client_request.client_ip):
            return RateLimitResponse()

        # Try cache first
        cached_response = self.cache.get(client_request.url)
        if cached_response and not cached_response.is_expired():
            return cached_response

        # Forward request to destination
        try:
            response = await self.forward_to_destination(client_request)

            # Cache if cacheable
            if response.is_cacheable():
                self.cache.store(client_request.url, response)

            return response

        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Forward proxy error: {e}")
            return ErrorResponse(str(e))

    def forward_to_destination(self, request):
        # Modify headers to anonymize client
        modified_headers = self.anonymize_headers(request.headers)

        # Create new request to destination
        return async_http_client.request(
            method=request.method,
            url=request.url,
            headers=modified_headers,
            body=request.body
        )
```

This implementation shows key forward proxy features:

- Access control through rules
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Caching for performance
- Request anonymization
- Error handling

### Reverse Proxy Implementation

A reverse proxy implementation showcasing load balancing and SSL termination:

```python
class ReverseProxy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.load_balancer = LoadBalancer()
        self.ssl_context = SSLContext()
        self.cache = Cache()

    async def handle_request(self, client_request):
        # SSL termination
        if client_request.is_ssl:
            decrypted_request = self.ssl_context.decrypt(client_request)
        else:
            decrypted_request = client_request

        # Try cache
        cached_response = self.cache.get(decrypted_request.url)
        if cached_response and not cached_response.is_expired():
            return self.ssl_context.encrypt(cached_response)

        # Get target backend server
        backend = self.load_balancer.get_backend()

        try:
            # Forward to backend
            response = await backend.handle_request(decrypted_request)

            # Cache if applicable
            if response.is_cacheable():
                self.cache.store(decrypted_request.url, response)

            # Encrypt response if needed
            if client_request.is_ssl:
                return self.ssl_context.encrypt(response)
            return response

        except BackendError as e:
            # Handle backend failure
            backup_backend = self.load_balancer.get_backup_backend()
            return await backup_backend.handle_request(decrypted_request)
```

### High Anonymity Proxy Implementation

A sophisticated proxy implementation focusing on maximum anonymity:

```python
class HighAnonymityProxy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.ip_rotator = IPRotator()
        self.header_sanitizer = HeaderSanitizer()
        self.encryption = EncryptionHandler()

    async def handle_request(self, client_request):
        # Rotate IP address
        proxy_ip = self.ip_rotator.get_next_ip()

        # Remove identifying headers
        sanitized_headers = self.header_sanitizer.clean_headers(
            client_request.headers,
            remove_list=[
                'X-Forwarded-For',
                'Via',
                'Referer',
                'Cookie',
                'User-Agent'
            ]
        )

        # Add misleading headers
        sanitized_headers.update(self.generate_anonymous_headers())

        # Encrypt payload if needed
        encrypted_body = self.encryption.encrypt(client_request.body)

        # Forward request through encrypted channel
        try:
            response = await self.send_encrypted_request(
                url=client_request.url,
                headers=sanitized_headers,
                body=encrypted_body,
                proxy_ip=proxy_ip
            )

            return self.sanitize_response(response)

        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Proxy error: {e}")
            return await self.fallback_handler(client_request)

    def generate_anonymous_headers(self):
        """Generate random-looking but valid headers."""
        return {
            'User-Agent': self.header_sanitizer.get_random_user_agent(),
            'Accept-Language': self.header_sanitizer.get_random_language(),
            'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip, deflate',
            'Connection': 'close'
        }
```

## 9. Load Balancers

Load balancers are crucial for distributing traffic and ensuring high availability. Let's explore different implementations and algorithms in detail.

### Round Robin Implementation

A simple but effective load balancing algorithm:

```python
class RoundRobinLoadBalancer:
    def __init__(self, servers):
        self.servers = servers
        self.current_index = 0
        self.lock = threading.Lock()

    def get_next_server(self):
        with self.lock:
            server = self.servers[self.current_index]
            self.current_index = (self.current_index + 1) % len(self.servers)
            return server

    def handle_server_failure(self, failed_server):
        """Remove failed server from rotation."""
        with self.lock:
            self.servers.remove(failed_server)
            if self.current_index >= len(self.servers):
                self.current_index = 0
```

### Weighted Round Robin Implementation

An advanced version that considers server capacity:

```python
class WeightedRoundRobinLoadBalancer:
    def __init__(self, servers_with_weights):
        # servers_with_weights: [(server, weight)]
        self.servers = servers_with_weights
        self.current_weights = [0] * len(servers_with_weights)
        self.lock = threading.Lock()

    def get_next_server(self):
        with self.lock:
            total_weight = sum(server[1] for server in self.servers)
            if total_weight == 0:
                raise NoAvailableServersError()

            max_weight = -1
            max_index = -1

            # Find server with highest current weight
            for i, (server, weight) in enumerate(self.servers):
                self.current_weights[i] += weight
                if self.current_weights[i] > max_weight:
                    max_weight = self.current_weights[i]
                    max_index = i

            # Decrease weight of selected server
            self.current_weights[max_index] -= total_weight
            return self.servers[max_index][0]
```

### Least Connections Implementation

A dynamic load balancing algorithm based on current connections:

```python
class LeastConnectionsLoadBalancer:
    def __init__(self, servers):
        self.servers = {server: 0 for server in servers}  # server: connection_count
        self.lock = threading.Lock()

    def get_next_server(self):
        with self.lock:
            if not self.servers:
                raise NoAvailableServersError()

            # Get server with minimum connections
            server = min(self.servers.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])[0]
            self.servers[server] += 1
            return server

    def release_connection(self, server):
        """Called when a connection is completed."""
        with self.lock:
            if server in self.servers:
                self.servers[server] -= 1
```

## 10. Databases

Understanding database systems is crucial for system design. Let's explore the different types, scaling strategies, and optimization techniques in detail.

### Types of Databases

#### Relational Databases (SQL)

Relational databases organize data into structured tables with predefined schemas. Let's examine a practical example of a typical e-commerce database design:

```sql
-- User management with authentication
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    last_login TIMESTAMP
);

-- Product catalog with inventory
CREATE TABLE products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    stock_quantity INTEGER NOT NULL,
    category_id INTEGER REFERENCES categories(id),
    CONSTRAINT positive_price CHECK (price > 0),
    CONSTRAINT positive_quantity CHECK (stock_quantity >= 0)
);

-- Order management with status tracking
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    CONSTRAINT valid_status CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'processing', 'shipped', 'delivered', 'cancelled'))
);
```

Key features of relational databases:

1. ACID Compliance:

   - Atomicity: Transactions are all-or-nothing
   - Consistency: Data remains valid after transactions
   - Isolation: Concurrent transactions don't interfere
   - Durability: Committed transactions are permanent

2. Transaction Management:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Create order
INSERT INTO orders (user_id, status, total_amount)
VALUES (123, 'pending', 99.99)
RETURNING id INTO @order_id;

-- Update inventory
UPDATE products
SET stock_quantity = stock_quantity - 1
WHERE id = 456 AND stock_quantity > 0;

-- Check if update was successful
IF ROW_COUNT() = 0 THEN
    ROLLBACK;
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Insufficient stock';
END IF;

COMMIT;
```

#### NoSQL Databases

NoSQL databases provide flexible schema design and horizontal scalability. Let's examine different types:

1. Document Databases (MongoDB example):

```javascript
// Flexible schema for product catalog
const productSchema = {
  name: String,
  price: Number,
  attributes: {
    // Flexible attributes per product category
    color: String,
    size: String,
    specifications: Object,
  },
  variants: [
    {
      sku: String,
      inventory: Number,
      price: Number,
    },
  ],
  // Nested arrays and objects are easily supported
  reviews: [
    {
      user_id: ObjectId,
      rating: Number,
      comment: String,
      helpful_votes: Number,
    },
  ],
};

// Example query with aggregation
db.products.aggregate([
  // Match products in specific category
  { $match: { category: "electronics" } },
  // Unwind reviews array
  { $unwind: "$reviews" },
  // Group by product and calculate average rating
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$_id",
      avgRating: { $avg: "$reviews.rating" },
      reviewCount: { $sum: 1 },
    },
  },
  // Sort by average rating
  { $sort: { avgRating: -1 } },
]);
```

2. Key-Value Stores (Redis example):

```python
class SessionStore:
    def __init__(self, redis_client):
        self.redis = redis_client
        self.session_ttl = 3600  # 1 hour

    def create_session(self, user_id, data):
        session_id = generate_secure_token()
        session_data = {
            'user_id': user_id,
            'created_at': datetime.now().isoformat(),
            **data
        }

        # Store session with expiration
        self.redis.setex(
            f"session:{session_id}",
            self.session_ttl,
            json.dumps(session_data)
        )
        return session_id

    def extend_session(self, session_id):
        # Extend session TTL if it exists
        if self.redis.exists(f"session:{session_id}"):
            self.redis.expire(
                f"session:{session_id}",
                self.session_ttl
            )
```

### Database Scaling Strategies

#### Vertical Scaling

Vertical scaling involves adding more resources to existing machines. Here's a systematic approach:

1. Resource Monitoring:

```python
class DatabaseMonitor:
    def check_resources(self):
        metrics = {
            'cpu_usage': self.get_cpu_usage(),
            'memory_usage': self.get_memory_usage(),
            'disk_io': self.get_disk_io(),
            'connection_count': self.get_connection_count()
        }

        return self.analyze_metrics(metrics)

    def analyze_metrics(self, metrics):
        recommendations = []

        if metrics['cpu_usage'] > 80:
            recommendations.append('Increase CPU cores')
        if metrics['memory_usage'] > 85:
            recommendations.append('Add more RAM')
        if metrics['disk_io'] > 90:
            recommendations.append('Upgrade to faster storage')

        return recommendations
```

#### Horizontal Scaling

1. Sharding Implementation:

```python
class DatabaseSharding:
    def __init__(self, shard_count):
        self.shard_count = shard_count
        self.shards = self.initialize_shards()

    def get_shard(self, key):
        """Determine shard for given key using consistent hashing."""
        shard_id = self.calculate_shard_id(key)
        return self.shards[shard_id]

    def calculate_shard_id(self, key):
        """Use consistent hashing to determine shard."""
        hash_value = self.hash_function(str(key))
        return hash_value % self.shard_count

    async def execute_query(self, key, query):
        shard = self.get_shard(key)
        return await shard.execute(query)
```

2. Replication Strategy:

```python
class DatabaseReplication:
    def __init__(self):
        self.primary = None
        self.secondaries = []
        self.replication_lag_threshold = timedelta(seconds=10)

    async def write_operation(self, query):
        """Execute write operation on primary and replicate."""
        # Execute on primary
        result = await self.primary.execute(query)

        # Replicate to secondaries asynchronously
        replication_tasks = [
            self.replicate_to_secondary(secondary, query)
            for secondary in self.secondaries
        ]

        await asyncio.gather(*replication_tasks)
        return result

    async def read_operation(self, query):
        """Execute read operation on appropriate server."""
        # Check replication lag
        available_secondaries = [
            s for s in self.secondaries
            if s.replication_lag < self.replication_lag_threshold
        ]

        if not available_secondaries:
            # Fall back to primary if no suitable secondary
            return await self.primary.execute(query)

        # Select least loaded secondary
        selected_secondary = min(
            available_secondaries,
            key=lambda s: s.current_load
        )

        return await selected_secondary.execute(query)
```

### Performance Optimization Techniques

1. Indexing Strategy:

```sql
-- Composite index for common query patterns
CREATE INDEX idx_products_category_price ON products(category_id, price);

-- Partial index for active users only
CREATE INDEX idx_active_users ON users(email)
WHERE active = true;

-- Index for full-text search
CREATE INDEX idx_product_search ON products
USING gin(to_tsvector('english', name || ' ' || description));
```

2. Query Optimization:

```python
class QueryOptimizer:
    def optimize_query(self, query, table_stats):
        """Optimize query based on table statistics."""
        analyzed_query = self.analyze_query(query)

        optimizations = []

        # Check for full table scans
        if analyzed_query.has_full_scan:
            optimizations.extend(self.suggest_indexes(analyzed_query))

        # Check for inefficient joins
        if analyzed_query.has_inefficient_joins:
            optimizations.extend(self.optimize_joins(analyzed_query))

        # Check for missing WHERE clauses
        if not analyzed_query.has_where_clause:
            optimizations.append("Add WHERE clause to limit results")

        return optimizations
```

## System Design Best Practices

### 1. Scalability Best Practices

When designing scalable systems, we should follow these fundamental principles:

**Start with Vertical Scaling, Plan for Horizontal**
Begin with the simplest solution and evolve as needed:

```python
class ScalabilityPlanner:
    def assess_scaling_needs(self, metrics):
        """Analyze metrics to determine scaling strategy."""
        current_load = metrics.get_current_load()
        growth_rate = metrics.get_growth_rate()
        cost_threshold = metrics.get_cost_threshold()

        if current_load < self.vertical_scaling_limit:
            return self.plan_vertical_scaling(current_load)
        else:
            return self.plan_horizontal_scaling(growth_rate)

    def plan_vertical_scaling(self, current_load):
        """Generate vertical scaling recommendations."""
        recommendations = []

        if current_load.cpu_usage > 70:
            recommendations.append({
                'action': 'Upgrade CPU',
                'current': current_load.cpu_specs,
                'recommended': self.calculate_cpu_upgrade(current_load)
            })

        if current_load.memory_usage > 80:
            recommendations.append({
                'action': 'Increase RAM',
                'current': current_load.memory_specs,
                'recommended': self.calculate_memory_upgrade(current_load)
            })

        return recommendations
```

### 2. Reliability Best Practices

Design for failure at every level:

**Circuit Breaker Pattern Implementation:**

```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = 'CLOSED'  # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.failure_threshold = 5
        self.reset_timeout = 60  # seconds
        self.last_failure_time = None

    async def execute(self, func, *args, **kwargs):
        if self.state == 'OPEN':
            if time.time() - self.last_failure_time > self.reset_timeout:
                self.state = 'HALF_OPEN'
            else:
                raise CircuitBreakerOpen("Circuit breaker is OPEN")

        try:
            result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
            if self.state == 'HALF_OPEN':
                self.state = 'CLOSED'
                self.failure_count = 0
            return result

        except Exception as e:
            self.failure_count += 1
            if self.failure_count >= self.failure_threshold:
                self.state = 'OPEN'
                self.last_failure_time = time.time()
            raise e
```

### 3. Security Best Practices

Implement security at every layer:

**Authentication and Authorization Implementation:**

```python
class SecurityManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.jwt_secret = os.getenv('JWT_SECRET')
        self.password_hasher = PasswordHasher()

    def authenticate_request(self, request):
        token = self.extract_token(request)
        if not token:
            raise UnauthorizedError("No token provided")

        try:
            payload = jwt.decode(token, self.jwt_secret, algorithms=['HS256'])
            return self.validate_permissions(payload)
        except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
            raise TokenExpiredError("Token has expired")
        except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
            raise InvalidTokenError("Invalid token")

    def validate_permissions(self, payload):
        """Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)."""
        required_permissions = self.get_required_permissions(payload['route'])
        user_permissions = payload.get('permissions', [])

        if not all(perm in user_permissions for perm in required_permissions):
            raise ForbiddenError("Insufficient permissions")
```

### 4. Monitoring and Alerting Best Practices

Implement comprehensive monitoring:

**Monitoring System Implementation:**

```python
class SystemMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics_collector = MetricsCollector()
        self.alert_manager = AlertManager()
        self.thresholds = self.load_thresholds()

    async def monitor_system_health(self):
        """Continuous system monitoring."""
        while True:
            metrics = await self.metrics_collector.collect()

            # Performance metrics
            self.track_latency(metrics.latency)
            self.track_error_rates(metrics.errors)
            self.track_resource_usage(metrics.resources)

            # Business metrics
            self.track_user_activity(metrics.user_actions)
            self.track_transaction_volume(metrics.transactions)

            # Security metrics
            self.track_failed_logins(metrics.auth_failures)
            self.track_unusual_patterns(metrics.activity_patterns)

            await asyncio.sleep(self.collection_interval)

    def track_latency(self, latency_metrics):
        """Track and alert on latency issues."""
        for endpoint, latency in latency_metrics.items():
            if latency > self.thresholds['latency'][endpoint]:
                self.alert_manager.create_alert(
                    level='WARNING',
                    message=f'High latency detected for {endpoint}',
                    metrics={'current_latency': latency}
                )
```

### 5. Documentation Best Practices

Maintain comprehensive documentation:

**API Documentation Template:**

```python
def generate_api_documentation(api_spec):
    """Generate comprehensive API documentation."""
    doc = {
        'overview': {
            'title': api_spec.title,
            'version': api_spec.version,
            'description': api_spec.description
        },
        'authentication': {
            'type': api_spec.auth_type,
            'description': 'Detailed authentication process',
            'examples': generate_auth_examples()
        },
        'endpoints': [],
        'models': [],
        'examples': []
    }

    for endpoint in api_spec.endpoints:
        doc['endpoints'].append({
            'path': endpoint.path,
            'method': endpoint.method,
            'description': endpoint.description,
            'parameters': document_parameters(endpoint.parameters),
            'responses': document_responses(endpoint.responses),
            'examples': generate_endpoint_examples(endpoint)
        })

    return doc
```

### 6. Testing Best Practices

Implement comprehensive testing strategies:

**Load Testing Implementation:**

```python
class LoadTester:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics = []
        self.test_users = self.generate_test_users()

    async def run_load_test(self, target_url, concurrent_users, duration):
        """Execute load test with specified parameters."""
        start_time = time.time()

        # Create user sessions
        sessions = [
            self.simulate_user_session(user, target_url)
            for user in random.sample(self.test_users, concurrent_users)
        ]

        # Run concurrent sessions
        results = await asyncio.gather(*sessions)

        # Analyze results
        self.analyze_results(results, start_time, duration)

    async def simulate_user_session(self, user, target_url):
        """Simulate realistic user behavior."""
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            actions = self.generate_user_actions(user)
            results = []

            for action in actions:
                start_time = time.time()
                try:
                    response = await self.execute_action(session, action, target_url)
                    results.append({
                        'action': action,
                        'latency': time.time() - start_time,
                        'status': response.status
                    })
                except Exception as e:
                    results.append({
                        'action': action,
                        'error': str(e)
                    })

            return results
```

These best practices should guide the development of robust, scalable, and maintainable systems. Remember that best practices are guidelines rather than strict rules, and should be adapted based on specific requirements and constraints of your system.
